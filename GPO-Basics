🔹 GPO Basics

1️⃣ What is Group Policy (GPO)?
✅ GPO (Group Policy Object) is a feature of Active Directory (AD) used to centrally manage security settings, user preferences, and system configurations across multiple computers in a domain.

2️⃣ What are the types of Group Policies?
✅ Local Group Policy (LGPO) – Applies to a single computer.
✅ Domain-based GPO – Applied to AD objects (Users, Computers, OUs, Sites).

3️⃣ What is the difference between GPO and a Group Policy Preference (GPP)?
✅ GPOs enforce settings that users cannot change.
✅ GPPs apply settings but allow users to modify them.

4️⃣ Where are Group Policy settings stored?
✅ SYSVOL folder (\\DomainName\SYSVOL\Domain\Policies).
✅ Active Directory database for linked policies.

5️⃣ What is the order of GPO processing?
✅ LSDOU Order:
 • Local Policies
 • Site Policies
 • Domain Policies
 • OU Policies (Organizational Units)
✅ Lower-level GPOs override higher ones unless blocked or enforced.

🔹 GPO Configuration & Management

6️⃣ How do you apply Group Policy settings?
✅ Manually: Run

gpupdate /force

✅ Automatically: Policies apply at user login or system restart.

7️⃣ How do you check which GPOs are applied to a system?
✅ Run:

gpresult /r

✅ For detailed output:

gpresult /h C:\GPO_Report.html

8️⃣ What is the difference between Enforced and Block Inheritance?
✅ Enforced → Ensures the GPO is applied even if lower-level GPOs conflict.
✅ Block Inheritance → Prevents higher-level GPOs from affecting an OU.

9️⃣ What are Loopback Processing modes?
✅ Merge Mode – Combines user and computer policies.
✅ Replace Mode – Ignores user policies and enforces only computer policies.

🔟 How do you create a GPO?
✅ Use Group Policy Management Console (GPMC):
 • Open gpmc.msc.
 • Right-click Group Policy Objects → New GPO.
 • Edit settings using Group Policy Editor (gpedit.msc).
